    "I first thought about what defines a prime number. A prime number is one with 2 roots, 1 and itself. So my first attempt to find if a given number is prime would be to loop through all the numbers between 1 to that number exclusivly, and using the modulo operation, I would be able to determine if any number is not prime as they would divide evenly into one of the numbers, giving a modulo result of 0, for example to determine if 9 was prime we would calculate the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    9 % 2 = 1\n",
    "    9 % 3 = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "As one of the calculations equals 0, we know that 3 is a factor of 9, so we know 9 is not prime. If we exhaust all possible factors and none of them modulo to 0, we know the number is prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunatly this method is not very efficient as we do a lot of unnecessary calculations, which results in this having a very poor time complexity.\n",
